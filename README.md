## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Flavio and I have Bachelor degree in Information Systems, I am currently living in Barueri-SP. I like programing and my goal is to create awesome websites and applications that solve real world problems. Currently, I am looking for an opportunity as Junior Front-end developer.

## Here's some of the stuff I like to use
